                <h3>Preliminary Visualizations</h3>

                <br>

                <h4>Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        From the intelligence gathered in Slides <i>69 - 76</i>, it was observed that adding in additional characteristics, such as the number of symbols and number of digits, can help with classifying malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To further visualize this analysis, a scatterplot was created with the following characteristics:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>X Axis</i> = Number of Symbols
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Y Axis</i> = Number of Digits
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Red Dot</i> (<font style="color: red;">x</font>) = Not Malicious
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Blue Dot</i> (<font style="color: blue;">x</font>) = Is Malicious
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Initial Observations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        From the initial visualization, it can be observed that malicious URLs are associated with larger amounts of numbers and/or symbols (within this dataset). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All non-malicious URLs can be seen near the bottom-left corner, indicating a minimal presence of numbers and symbols in their URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphing this dataset helped visualize some potential discrepancies/dissimilarities in the dataset that will be further discussed in Milestone 4.
                    </li>
                </ul>
