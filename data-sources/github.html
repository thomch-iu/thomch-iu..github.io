                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Github is a collection of data repositories that can glean intelligence related to customized source code, exploits, and vulnerabilities specific to the payment industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data is accumulated via user submission of files and code for versioning control, storage, and retrieval.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are hundreds of thousands of Github repositories available for searching and cloning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Github is a vital data source to gather threat intelligence on customized software exploitations and vulnerabilities related to the payment industry. It is also a highly useful tool for more holistic OSINT data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Collection Strategy:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Github data was collected using a customized API and Python Script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application Postman was used to generate a client API call and dump the response into a JSON format:
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                            <img src="/thomch-iu-github/assets/images/GitHub_Collection.png" alt="GitHub collection through Postman" />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This approach was taken to test the API call and determine if the data received was relevant before creating an automated method of data collection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A customized Python script was created to automate the API call and convert the JSON response into a CSV file for analysis:
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                            <img src="/thomch-iu-github/assets/images/GitHub_Script.png" alt="GitHub Python Script" />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The script was created so that the API could be called programmatically each day to collect the data set and store into an AWS S3 bucket.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
