                <br>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        PhishTank is an open-source site (operated by Cisco) that allows individuals to publish, upload, and verify malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With phishing being a top cyberthreat to the financial industry, this data will provide significant value and insight for identifying malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitoring reports and looking for similar URLs can help companies alert consumers of potential phishing attempts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An influx of phishing reports for malicious URLs mimicking a company’s site can indicate the overall business/industry may be a susceptible target of an attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PhishTank data is publicly available through a link to download an ongoing CSV of their data.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Collection Strategy:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The PhishTank data was collected using a provided endpoint and a combination of AWS services
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PhishTank’s data is updated every hour, so an automated retrieval and storage process has been set up to ensure the analyses reflect near real-time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Lambda Function has been setup with a Python script to retrieve PhishTank’s CSV and upload it to an S3 Bucket.

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Rule has been created in Amazon EventBridge to automate the script’s execution every 30 minutes (if the initial retrieval fails, try again in 30 minutes - PhishTank has rate limiting).
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The S3 Bucket stores the new version every hour (previous versions are stored as backups).
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
