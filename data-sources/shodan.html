                <h3>Collection Strategy:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Shodan data was collected using a customized API and Python Script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application Postman was used to generate a client API call and dump the response into a JSON format:
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                            <img src="/assets/images/Shodan_Collection.png" alt="Shodan collection through Postman" />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This approach was taken to test the API call and determine if the data received was relevant before creating an automated method of data collection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A customized Python script was created to automate the API call and convert the JSON response into a CSV file for analysis:
                        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                            <img src="/assets/images/Shodan_Script.png" alt="Shodan Python Script" />
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The script was created so that the API could be called programmatically each day to collect the data set and store into an AWS S3 bucket.
                    </li>
                </ul>
