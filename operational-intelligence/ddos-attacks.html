                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Dissemination</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tactics used to lower the probability of DDoS attacks should be shared amongst all staff because it is a group effort from all employees.</li>
                    <li>Group meetings (virtual or in person), emails, etc.</li>
                    <li>As the cybersecurity unit you should monitor passwords, firewall, and ports because these are the typical channels that DDoS attacks are executed</li>
                                    
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Course of Action</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mandatory company wide standards should be created amongst all employees to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create stronger passwords and enforce MFA for access to sensitive data, valuable assets, etc.</li>
                            <li>Frequent port and firewall monitoring</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Iterative Challenges</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To prevent future DDoS attacks investments in strong network security
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anti Virus/Anti Malware software - helps detect and remove malware and viruses</li>
                            <li>Firewall and intruder detection systems - would scan the traffic at each firewall barrier</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
