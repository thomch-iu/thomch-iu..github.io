                <!-- URL Classification Section -->
                <h4>URL Classification</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Through these findings, a tool can be created that acts as a middle step to scan links before being opened:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Upon clicking a link from an application (ex: email), the browser will first open a window that passes the target URL through a classification model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the link is deemed malicious, a warning will show to the user and suggest they proceed with caution
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        This type of tool will not be too disruptive and rather require an additional click to proceed (or automatically proceed if a link is determined not malicious).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This tool can help companies in the financial/banking industry reduce potential damages by helping prevent their employees from interacting with phishing threats.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Identify new data sources and filters with an even higher relevancy to  the electronic payment industry
