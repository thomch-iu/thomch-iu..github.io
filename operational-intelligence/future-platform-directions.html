                <!-- URL Classification Section -->
                <h4>URL Classification</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Through these findings, a tool can be created that acts as a middle step to scan links before being opened:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Upon clicking a link from an application (ex: email), the browser will first open a window that passes the target URL through a classification model
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the link is deemed malicious, a warning will show to the user and suggest they proceed with caution
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        This type of tool will not be too disruptive and rather require an additional click to proceed (or automatically proceed if a link is determined not malicious).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This tool can help companies in the financial/banking industry reduce potential damages by helping prevent their employees from interacting with phishing threats.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Text Mining Section -->
                <h4>Text Mining</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use the mined intelligence to feed new analytical threat models
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add direct feed from data sources such as Shodan and NVD.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify new data sources and filters with an even higher relevancy to  the electronic payment industry
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <!-- DDoS Attacks Section -->
                <h4>DDoS Attacks</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid the use of public ports
                        <ul>
                            <li>The most at risk for DDoS attacks</li>
                            <li>Invest in the use of private ports</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>Installation of VPNs to protect and hide IP Addresses
                            <ul>
                                <li>Makes it difficult for attackers to locate and target you</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                        
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- IP Geolocation Section -->
                <h4>IP Geolocation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Do IP Geolocation on list of phishing sites periodically so trend analysis can be done</li>
                    <li>Make global map interactive so consumers of intelligence do not have to refer back to a data table for details</li>
                    <li>Integrate the global map and trends graph into a dashboard for decision makers</li>
                    <li>Investigate the Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with the phishing site IP address. There might be more insight to be gained. I.E. someone took over a legitimate site, vs., malicious actors are renting cloud resources (Azure, AWS, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
