                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Dissemination</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Phishing is a threat that impacts the entire financial/banking industry, so any research done and/or tools created by a company should be shared amongst all companies to help work towards minimizing these threats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As a phishing attack on any employee can impact a whole organization, all employees should be made aware of phishing threats and how to detect them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Through the findings, guides can be created that are shared amongst all employees of companies outlining common trends/patterns to look for in links before clicking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With malicious URLs being everchanging, employees should report any suspicions from previously clicked links and/or anytime they receive a potentially suspicious link. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Courses of Action</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To help protect organizations as a whole, companies can:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Implement 3rd-party (and/or develop in-house) tools/software that scan links prior to being opened and/or loading the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create stricter criteria for email filters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        To help ensure employees remain vigilant to phishing threats, companies can implement internally planned/safe phishing exercises.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Those who report or don't click the links are rewarded whereas those who do click are assigned additional training.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This helps companies monitor awareness of these threats among their employees and adjust trainings if/where necessary.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Discovered Intelligence - Iterative Changes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        With the dataset for non-malicious URLs being limited to <b><i>500</i></b> URLs, we would like to find a source that provides more data to create a larger dataset and even out the balance between malicious vs. non-malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the datasets provided are more generalized URLs (vs. industry specific), we would like to find datasets that are specific to the financial industry.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This will help provide more detail to the analysis and potentially uncover additional characteristics/themes in the URLs.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensure the data from both sources is similar and not missing certain characteristics.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It was noticed that not all the URLs provided by <i>Moz.com</i> had <i>HTTP/HTTPS</i> and <i>www</i> present which creates potential discrepancies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Additionally, URLs provided by <i>Moz.com</i> did not contain URL parameters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
