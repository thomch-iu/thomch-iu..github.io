                <br>

                <h3>Analytical Approaches and Justification</h3>

                <br>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Task:</b> Gather data regarding the most vulnerabilities in Payment assets (e.g. word count).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Value:</b> Can determine the most vulnerable assets by the most critical threats. 
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Companies can use this intelligence to flag URLs as risky.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While it is ultimately up to the user to determine if they click a link, being able to provide a potential warning is extremely valuable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Potential Value: Identifying specific features from the URLs (ex: number of  symbols/digits/etc.) to see if they can assist with accuracy of predictions. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Process</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 1 :</b> Gathered NVD data source CSV file from AWS data repository
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 2 :</b> Copied text from description field into text file for all 2022 records (Approx. 3,500)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 3 :</b> Preprocessed the data - Stop Words and Stemming by determining
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Removed irrelevant words “the”, “a”, “of”, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduced words down to their root word “pay = payment, payments,” “bank = banks”, “
                        </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step 4 :</b> Used “databasic.io” to find the most commonly used words to describe the vulnerabilities and create visualizations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Next Steps :</b> Find vulnerabilities most relevant to the identified threats and determine what systems, OS, and platforms they specifically refer to. This is how we will reach our stated goal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
