                <h2>URL Classification</h2>

                <br>

                <h3>Analytical Approaches and Justification</h3>

                <br>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Task:</b> Analyze data from PhishTank to assist with classifying URLs as malicious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Value:</b> Being able to identify the maliciousness of URLs can save individuals and organizations from making extremely costly mistakes. 
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Companies can use this intelligence to flag URLs as risky.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While it is ultimately up to the user to determine if they click a link, being able to provide a potential warning is extremely valuable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Potential Value: Identifying specific features from the URLs (ex: number of  symbols/digits/etc.) to see if they can assist with accuracy of predictions. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>Data Additions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The current dataset contains approximately <i>8,000</i> malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the end goal being to classify if a URL is malicious, additional data needs to be added with valid/safe URLs to help train the model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Moz.com provides a CSV of some of the most popular websites.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The dataset is limited to <i>500</i> records.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h4>Feature Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The data provided by PhishTank is very valuable; however, it lacks detailed information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two of the provided columns include "verified" and "online" but they will always be "yes" for our data set due to the nature of PhishTank's file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the "target" column has a handful of records relating to the financial industry, the vast majority is classified as "Other".
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Feature Additions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To assist with the classification model, pre-processing was performed on the data to provide additional features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The following columns were added to the dataset:

                    <li>
                        After the pre-processing, the final dataset includes a combination of <i>500</i> safe URLs and approximately <i>8,000</i> malicious URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h3>Key Insights and Intelligence</h3>

                <br>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To assist with classification, the Random Forest algorithm was used on the datasets. WEKA was used as the software tool to execute the process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The dataset contains <i>9,220</i> instances (URLs).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>66%</i> of the dataset was used for training and the remainder was used to test the model.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="/assets/images/weka-overview.png" alt="Initial Overview of WEKA for URL Classification" />
                </div>
                <br>

                <h4>Initial Results</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Prior to performing any pre-processing, the initial dataset was passed through a Random Forest to see how it would perform with fewer attributes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For this analysis, the two attributes were:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>url</i>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>is_malicious</i>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        From the initial passthrough, the model correctly classified <i>94.4179%</i> of the URLs as malicious or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Of the <i>3,135</i> instances tested, <i>2,960</i> of the instances were correctly classified as malicious while <i>175</i> instances were incorrectly classified as not malicious when they were malicious (false positives).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                    <img src="/assets/images/weka-initial-results.png" alt="Initial results from WEKA for URL Classification" />
                </div>
                <br>

                <h4>Pre-Processing Results</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After testing the precision of the initial dataset with <i>2</i> attributes, the full/final dataset was used with all <i>7</i> attributes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the additional features included that outline specific characteristics of the URLs, the hope/expectation is that the classification model will have a better likelihood of correctly classifying the URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With more attributes, the model was significantly more precise and correctly classified <i>99.0431%</i> of the URLs as malicious or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Of the <i>3,135</i> instances tested, <i>2,960</i> of the instances were correctly classified while <i>30</i> instances were incorrectly classified as not malicious when they were malicious (false positives).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h4>Smaller Dataset</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While the model was significantly more precise with additional features, the ratio of safe URLs to malicious URLs was about <i>500</i> to <i>8000</i>, or <i>1:16</i>. This could potentially skew the results due to class imbalance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our Team wanted to test the effectiveness of adjusting the overall dataset (with 7 attributes) to a closer ratio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As Moz.com only provides the top <i>500</i> URLs, the data from PhishTank was reduced to <i>1,000</i> URLs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The count of records in the new dataset was <i>1,500</i>:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>2/3 (1,000)</i> of the URLs are malicious.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>1/3 (500)</i> of the URLs are not malicious.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        With a smaller dataset and closer ratio, the model correctly classified 100% of the URLs as malicious or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All <i>510</i> instances tested were correctly classified:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>346</i> instances were correctly classified as malicious URLs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>164</i> instances were correctly classified as non-malicious URLs.
                        </li>

                        Looking at additional characteristics of a URL can help with identifying if they are malicious.

                            Malicious URLs averaged a length of <i>~52.94</i> characters, <i>~4.55</i> digits, and <i>~8.51</i> symbols.
